Program overview: Company XYZ is preparing to introduce a new type of crop product to farmers in the upcoming year, 2024.
XYZ conducted a research trial from 2016 to 2022 for this product, which has shown a significant increase in crop yield. This year, the program is limited to a few states: IA, IL, MO, IN, and NE, all within the USA. However, after 2024, the company plans to launch this product in more states across the US.
For the trial period, the company will send their own agronomist to collect data and monitor the fields throughout the season. Farmers who choose to participate will receive compensation based on the amount of land (in acres) they commit to the trial. Each farmer has the option to allocate up to 1000 acres for this trial. Payment to the growers will be divided into two parts: an initial 50% upon agreement, and the remaining 50% after the harvest is completed. The compensation rate is set at $10 per acre, with a maximum potential payout of $10,000. The company's objective is to involve around 200 farmers from this specific region. It's important to note that responses received after 09/30/2023 will not be eligible for participation in this program.
Participating farmers will also have the opportunity to collaborate with Company XYZ. As an added benefit, they will receive exclusive offers for significant discounts on various other products from the company. So, not only can farmers benefit from the new crop product, but they can also enjoy discounts and collaboration opportunities.
This product stands out for several reasons. It has the ability to yield higher crops, it's environmentally friendly, it has better survival rates during tough weather conditions, and it comes with a user-friendly protocol. To take part in the program, farmers need to meet certain requirements. These include having prior trial experience, using cover crops in their fields, not participating in a similar survey with other companies in 2024, and agreeing to complete two short 30-minute written surveys in 2024.
